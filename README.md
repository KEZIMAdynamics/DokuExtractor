to extract data from invoices and feed it an invoice from a previously unknown supplier, DokuExtractor
can figure out which information you want to extract and prepares a new template for you
- Calculated values based on extracted data - Can be used to validate a document or to create data
 which is not even in the actual document if you need to

- Can be embedded as library into your projects or used as a standalone application
